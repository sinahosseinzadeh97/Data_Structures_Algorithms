# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

Welcome to the **Data Structures & Algorithms Practice** repository! This project is designed to guide you through the essential topics and problem-solving patterns commonly encountered in technical interviews and competitive programming.

## Repository Structure

Each folder represents a chapter focused on a specific data structure or algorithm. Inside, you'll find:

* **README.md**: An overview of the topic and key concepts.
* **Problems/**: A collection of coding challenges to reinforce your understanding.
* **Solutions/**: Example implementations and explanations.

2. **Arrays & Strings**

   * Fundamental operations on arrays and strings.
   * Two-pointer and sliding window techniques.

3. **Hashing**

   * Using hash maps and hash sets.
   * Collision handling and performance trade-offs.

4. **Linked Lists**

   * Singly, doubly, and circular lists.
   * Pointer manipulation and common patterns.

5. **Stacks & Queues**

   * LIFO and FIFO data structures.
   * Applications like parentheses matching and sliding window.

6. **Trees & Graphs**

   * Binary trees, BSTs, and general graphs.
   * Traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS) and path finding.

7. **Heaps**

   * Priority queues and heap operations.
